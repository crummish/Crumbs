			Fixed box select renderer being a little inefficient
			Added simple polygon theme texture type
			Added quick wildcard button in item selection
			Added a new config for server operators
			Changed how the tray overlap and locking works (may tweak again later)
			NOTES:
			* New compressed theme format coming soon. Will be optional. Resource pack based themes will still be supported.
			* New "Doze" theme(s) in the works. See the Discord for more info.

		BetterQuesting-3.5.320.jar:
			Fixed another source of progression desync
			Fixed invites expiring before they arrive (appeared as if they never sent)
			Fixed text colour on the party list names not working properly
			Added button to lock the chapter select tray open temporarily

			Improved the new quest line screen with new icons, tooltips and adjusted tray sizes
			Added more preset icons
			Fixed animated GUI trays jittering due to floating point errors in interpolation math
			Fixed quest line screen not updating when icon states change
			Fixed a broken edge case in item NBT comparison
			Fixed build name in database files potentially saving the wrong mod info
			Fixed more desync issues? (this is a blind fix. I couldn't actually recreate it in dev)

		BetterQuesting-3.5.318.jar:
			Fixed major bug resulting in task data loss and broken offline sync over LAN
			Fixed text boxes crashing the game when window dimensions are too narrow
			Fixed scrolling panels not reporting scroll wheel event usage properly
			Added a brand new look to the quest line screen! Feedback welcome
			NOTE:
			* There may still be some left over issues from the progression system changes (for example offline sync was supposed to be working again). If you think something is not sharing progress but should then consult the issue tracker and leave me a message.
			* The new GUIs are NOT designed for the old theme scale and will look odd, squished, sometimes just outright broken. The themes will be redesigned later to deal with these new dimensions.

		BetterQuesting-3.5.317.jar:
			Fixed OSS not accepting piped fluids from some mods
			Fixed OSS throwing console errors when inserting items before setup

		BetterQuesting-3.5.316.jar:

		BetterQuesting-3.5.313.jar:
			Fixed quest progress in LAN SMP not saving, de-syncing and breaking all manner of behaviours
			Fixed party invite list not updating properly resulting in overlapped buttons and text
			Fixed expired invites not being cleared from the client side
			Fixed chapter sort order not syncing properly

		BetterQuesting-3.5.312.jar:
			Fixed items reverting to air in editors when set above 127 (probably important for modpacks with large item tasks and rewards)
			Fixed NBT short values parsing incorrectly as floats in editors

		BetterQuesting-3.5.311.jar:
			Fixed some minor transparency issues with theme textures
			Fixed edit mode not working for the host after Opening To LAN with cheats enabled
			Changed New Test theme textures slightly
			NOTES:
			We're officially out of betas again. I'm considering these stable enough for mainstream use (API is a bit messy though). Now it's on to redesigning the terrible UI layout at long last.
			Also 1.14.4 is still not coming any time soon.

			* Depending on how stable this version is, this will likely be the last beta build before resuming normal releases
			* There are more major rewrites planned in future but those are likely a few months away yet
			* This marks the end of the networking overhaul making questing servers a bit more friendly on players with weak connections
			* ...and no I'm not updating to 1.14.4 any time soon. Still quite a lot of work to do here before then

		BetterQuesting-3.5.309.jar:
			Fixed item selection screen crashing when air is given an ore dictionary name
			Fixed potential threading issue with unexpected shutdowns clearing databases before saving them

			Added texture_empty to possible theme texture options to hide GUI elements entirely

		BetterQuesting-3.5.308.jar:
			Fixed quest line reordering deleting everything instead
			Fixed quest line deletions not working
			Fixed quest tooltips not updating timers
			Changed repeat timers to be based on real time (still measured in ticks)
			Changed test theme scrollbars and inner panels
			Added the ability to switch between repeating based on completion time or fixed intervals (e.g. resetting every hour on the hour)

		BetterQuesting-3.5.307.jar:
			Fixed party invites not sending due to missing expiry timestamp
			Fixed invitations not syncing info about the inviting party

			IMPORTANT NOTES:
			* Shared party progression is currently not active. Functionality will return in a later build in a new form. Existing progress will be honoured however it will revert back to individual input.
			* This build is NOT final and may undergo further changes to refine the new networking and resolve bugs that may have resulted from such extensive rewrites.

	Better Questing - Standard Expansion (StandardExpansion-3.4.159.jar --> StandardExpansion-3.4.173.jar):
		StandardExpansion-3.4.173.jar:
			Fixed crash when using interaction tasks without JEI installed
			Changed "NULL" fallback loot chest to "No Loot Setup"
			Added NBT flag to Loot Chests to force show rarity outside of edit mode
			READ ME:
			"NULL" or "No Loot Setup" is intended. THIS IS NOT A BUG!
			The dungeon loot fallback has been removed and will not be coming back.
			If you wish to use vanilla loot tables such as dungeon loot then use the intended chest type for it.

		StandardExpansion-3.4.172.jar:
			Fixed FTBQ importer not including chapter icons
			Fixed FTBQ importing blank icons for some tasks
			Fixed empty loot chests crashing the game
			Fixed item task party detection issue
			Fixed fluid task party detection issue
			Reworked every theme

		StandardExpansion-3.4.171.jar:
			Quick Fix for 3.4.170. See other changelog for full list
			Fixed item detection tasks calculating combined totals wrong leading to some players not receiving any progression

		StandardExpansion-3.4.170.jar:
			Fixed Fluid Tasks consuming more fluid than necessary in submission stations
			Fixed Fluid Tasks ignoring minimum drain amounts from fluid handlers

			NOTE: Offline changes are NOT retroactive!

		StandardExpansion-3.4.169.jar:
			Fixed scoreboard reference data being erased over LAN play
			Fixed task editors not using new net code (caused some edits to not apply)
			Added the ability for item and fluid tasks in detect mode to scan the combined inventories of the entire party (saves having to move items to one person just for the task to complete)

		StandardExpansion-3.4.168.jar:
			Fixed loot chest tooltips showing its loot table name outside of edit mode
			Removed dungeon loot fallback (constantly broke. Defaults to empty now)
			Added new loot chest type that contains a fixed set of items

			Fixed block break tasks not saving progression data
			Added option to switch command rewards back to non-script interpretation (old functionality)

		StandardExpansion-3.4.166.jar:
			Fixed retrieval task logic functioning back to front and detecting/eating everything except the items it was set for
			Fixed crafting tasks not saving any progression rendering them unusable
			Fixed fluid tasks not working at all when set to ignore NBT

		StandardExpansion-3.4.165.jar:
			Updated to support BQ 3.5.310

		StandardExpansion-3.4.164.jar:
			Fixed advancement tasks not using partial writes
			Fixed interact tasks breaking when attempting to sync partial data
			Added shared progress support back to crafting tasks
			Notes:
			I have been constantly re-thinking how to do progression sharing, dealing with offline players, ones that don't have the same unlocked quests, dupe exploitation, etc.
			There are a few solutions I have come up with but some may have more damaging side effects than others or not be backwards compatible. I encourage anyone who wants to give their input on these issues to contact me on the Discord and hopefully I can think of a new solution.
			PS: No I'm not going back to the old system where you could drag users to end game rewards. It was way too exploitable and has already been abused by players on servers.

		StandardExpansion-3.4.163.jar:
			Fixed loot chests throwing an error and disappearing
			Fixed location task inversion not including dimension checks

		StandardExpansion-3.4.161.jar:
			Updated to support BQ 3.5.305
			Fixed crash when JEI was not installed
			IMPORTANT NOTES:
			* Shared party progression is currently not active. Functionality will return in a later build in a new form. Existing progress will be honoured however it will revert back to individual input.
			* This build is NOT final and may undergo further changes to refine the new networking and resolve bugs that may have resulted from such extensive rewrites.

If you have a problem open an issue in the tracker. * Option to turn off the potion icon display to the left of the inventory screen. You will have to enable.

			# Fixed issue #362, where the game would crash when summoned creatures were killed by forest of thorns with CoFH Core installed

			* Smoke bombs now apply blindness to mobs as well as the mind trick effect - this should make it work better with Dynamic Stealth

			> Spell properties files can now be overridden globally in config/ebwizardry/spells
			> Spell properties files can now be overridden for specific worlds in [world save]/data/spells
			> Moved the main config file to the new ebwizardry folder because it makes more sense for it to be there now

			> Allow spell books to set custom GUI textures
			> Tweaks to loot functions and wizards to accommodate the changes
			* Updated the crystal ore picture in The Wizard's Handbook
			* Rebalanced wand progression, it should be a lot less of a grind now, especially at lower tiers
			* Increased the health threshold for the amulet of transience, it should now trigger more often
			* Fast worldgen now performs a simple check for water instead of just ignoring ocean biomes, so it shouldn't generate structures underwater
			* Improved the descriptions of some of the structure generation settings to make it clearer how to disable them completely
			# The looting spell context now works properly
			# Fixed issue #186 (also #269), a crash during world generation with Dynamic Trees installed - fancy worldgen should now work again with Dynamic Trees

			# Fixed issue #244, where arcane jammer would sometimes not work properly on evokers
			# Fixed issue #245, where the client and server would sometimes select different forfeits

			# Fixed issue #256, where removing spells (either by updating from an older version or uninstalling a spell pack) would result in various spell book and scroll metadata mismatches
			# Fixed issue #257, where the ring of condensing and amulet of transience would only recharge wands/armour on the client side, meaning the charge would reset to its previous value when the item was moved around
			# Fixed issue #260, where lightning wraith spawners would only work during thunderstorms
			# Fixed issue #267, a block detection misalignment that caused block properties to be queried on the wrong block in various spells

			Version 4.2.2 - More tweaks and fixes

			+ Added support for WAWLA enchantment descriptions to the en_us and en_gb lang files, fixing #210
			+ Added a 5x bonus progression modifier for casting an undiscovered spell for the first time

			# Fixed issue #171, where the game would crash with a JSON syntax error when recipes referenced from the handbook were removed - a blank recipe grid is now displayed instead when this happens

		Electroblob's Wizardry - 4.2.0 - MC 1.12.2:
			Key:
			^ Version updates
			+ Added features
			* Changed features
			# Bugfixes
			* Removed features
			Version 4.2.0 - An update so big the changelog is in multiple parts!
			General:
			^ Updated to Forge 1.12.2 - 14.23.5.2814
			* Sanitised the jar filename a bit (removed the spaces and the apostrophe, apparently Maven doesn't like them)
			Cosmetic:
			+ Added many new particle effects to various spells
			+ Added a variety of new sounds, including spell selection, spell binding in the arcane workbench, and casting of various spells
			+ The arcane workbench GUI now has a fancy animation when the apply button is pressed
			+ Conjured items now have an appearing/disappearing animation
			+ Creatures with the frostbite effect now show an icy layer over their skin
			+ Wizard robes now bend when the wearer is sneaking or sitting down
			+ Legendary wizard armour now has its own armour texture variants (the items still look the same)
			+ The spell HUD has a new default texture and now supports different skins defined using JSON files in resource packs, which can be selected in the config menu - the base mod now comes with 19 different skins to choose from!
			+ The spell HUD now shows the previous and next spells and has a spell-switching animation
			+ Sixth sense and transience (along with two of the new spells) now have fancy shaders!
			+ The spell HUD position config option now has four more options allowing the HUD to switch from left to right depending on which hand the active wand is held in
			+ Wands now display their progression when advanced tooltips are enabled
			+ Added a spells sound category, use the slider in Options -> Music & Sounds to change the volume of spells separately to other sounds
			+ Added a config option to turn off spell shaders
			+ Added a config option to reverse the spell switching scroll direction
			* The default spell HUD scroll direction has been reversed so it works the way you'd expect it to with the new animation
			* The spell HUD now scales itself to get out of the way of the hotbar and offhand slot - this normally only happens with a large GUI scale or a small game window, and can be avoided by changing the HUD position, GUI scale or the player's primary hand
			* Completely rewrote the rendering for arc/lightning ray/chain lightning, it is now fully 3D and no longer an entity, resulting in improved performance
			* Completely rewrote the rendering for forcefields, they are now actual spheres and not made of particles, and have particle effects when things hit them
			* Shockwave has a new animation and sound
			* Rewrote the particle system to use the texture atlas, resulting in a major performance improvement for large numbers of particles (such as with the blizzard spell)
			* Particles can now have simple physics, for example, flame ray spreads out when it hits a block
			* Spirit animals now fade away when dispelled
			* All sounds are now defined in separate sound events
			* Continuous spell sounds are now looped nicely, with start and end sections and a much longer loop
			* Retextured most of the blocks
			* Retextured nearly all of the items, including all of the wands
			* Retextured a number of spell icons
			* Retextured a few entities
			* Retextured all of the book GUIs and added subtly different variations for different tiers of spell book
			* Updated the Wizardry logo
			* Most chat readouts (excluding commands) have been changed to toast notifications above the hotbar
			# Fixed render pass/layer issues for various translucent things
			# Fixed a bug where status effects with custom particles (e.g. frostbite) would not update on the client when applied to non-players, causing them to appear to continue indefinitely
			# Status effects with custom particles no longer mix their colours with other status effects
			# Ice spikes no longer appear black when inside blocks
			# Fixed transparency for cobwebs from the cobwebs spell
			# Flame particles no longer appear dull and translucent for some spells (firebomb, flame ray, phoenix attacks, etc.)
			# Fixed various spells where particles that were meant to appear did not
			# Fixed z-fighting on the brim of wizard hats when they have the enchantment glint effect
			# Wizard hats no longer clip through the hat layer of player skins, fixing issue #83 - the brim is slightly wider now to keep it in proportion
			# The arcane workbench in-world animation is now smoother
			# The spell HUD no longer displays in spectator mode
			# Wizards no longer spawn heal particles around themselves when they first spawn
			* Removed the mana readout in item tooltips (you can still view the exact mana in an arcane workbench - or by pressing F3 + H, you spoilsport...)
			Blocks:
			+ Added runestone and runestone pedestals
			+ Added elemental crystal block variants
			+ Stones of transportation now display particles at the positions of any stones missing from the circle when right-clicked
			* Magic light blocks can now be broken in creative mode
			# Fixed issue #128, where magic light blocks would grow indefinitely on server/client desync
			# Arcane workbenches no longer connect to fences, panes, iron bars or walls
			Items:
			+ Added artefacts! These can only be found by exploring shrines, which will each contain a single artefact
			+ Added elemental crystal variants, which may be used to craft novice elemental wands
			+ Added wand progression - a new mechanic in which wands gain progression from casting spells and must reach a certain amount of progression before they can be upgraded to the next tier (tomes of arcana are still required to do the actual upgrading)
			+ Added a config option to revert to legacy wand levelling, because I know you'll ask
			+ Added 3 armour enchantments: Magic Protection, Frost Protection and Shock Protection - these can be applied to any armour, including wizard armour, and may be applied to or found in enchanted books
			+ Wizard armour items now show a tooltip in the arcane workbench with how much mana they have left
			+ Added spark bombs as an item - they work in much the same way as firebombs, poison bombs and smoke bombs and can be crafted or found in dungeon chests
			+ Added wand melee upgrades, which allow wands to deal more melee damage
			+ Added purifying elixir for removing curses
			+ Added astral diamonds, which can be found as loot and are now required to buy master-tier items
			+ There are now three different sizes of mana flask, which restore 300, 700 and 1400 mana respectively and can occasionally be found in dungeon chests or dropped by wizards, as well as being craftable as before
			+ Added spawn eggs for all of wizardry's non-vanilla summoned creatures
			* Magic wands are now empty when first crafted
			* Wizard armour can now be enchanted using an enchantment table, as well as with an anvil as before (though that was not intended prior to this release!) - fixes issue #139
			* The cost reduction provided per piece of wizard armour has been reduced to 15%, however there is now an additional 20% bonus for wearing a complete set, meaning that the cost reduction for a full set is still 80% as before
			* When invisible, wizard armour is now ignored when calculating the mob detection penalty for wearing armour
			* Wizard armour now doesn't render at all when invisible, rather than just using an invisible texture
			* Siphon upgrades have been buffed to grant at least 5 mana per level for each kill (it was 3 before)
			* All wands are now available in the creative inventory, and wizardry gear (wands, armour and artefacts) now has its own separate tab
			* Spell books and scrolls now stack to 16 (the arcane workbench slots still only accept one spell book at a time, but you can now enchant a stack of 16 scrolls at once)
			# Wands and conjured items can no longer be enchanted using an anvil
			Worldgen/loot:
			+ Added obelisks
			+ Added shrines
			+ Added some of the new items to loot tables
			+ Firebombs, poison bombs, smoke bombs, spark bombs and a selection of spell scrolls now have a chance to generate in jungle temple dispensers
			+ Added the 'fancy' structure generation algorithm to determine whether there is space for the structure to spawn, meaning structures are very unlikely to spawn on cliffs, steep slopes, or other structures, and will clear any floating trees left behind after they generate - there is a config option to turn this off for potentially quicker worldgen
			+ Added the option 'undiscovered_bias' to the random_spell loot function; this option allows a weighting towards undiscovered spells to be specified, with 0 being no weighting (as it was previously) and 1 producing guaranteed undiscovered spells
			+ Added a config option to change the chance for a tower to contain an evil wizard and loot chest, see issue #133
			+ Added a config option to add, change and remove structure file locations, allowing pack makers to add and remove structure variants from resource packs rather than being limited to just overriding the default ones
			+ Added a config option to specify the loot injection locations, meaning you can now add wizardry's standard set of dungeon loot to any loot table from any mod
			* All structures now use the structure file system, meaning you can spawn them yourself using structure blocks and change them using resource packs
			* The tower rarity config option is now the 1/n chance per chunk that a wizard tower will generate, allowing for finer control over their rarity - multiply pre-4.2 values by 70 for an equivalent value in the new system
			* Wizard tower materials have been tweaked a little: cobblestone and stone brick towers now have random mossy blocks and towers in mesas are now made of red sandstone
			* Structures now ignore trees when finding a space to generate, meaning they should now spawn at the same rate in forests as everywhere else
			* The spell books and scrolls generated in dungeon chests and wizard tower chests (as well as shrines and obelisks) now have an undiscovered bias of 0.3 by default, meaning 65% of generated spell books and scrolls will contain spells the player has not yet discovered
			* Mob spell book drops are now defined in a loot table, and mobs can be blacklisted or whitelisted for this in the config
			* Mobs no longer drop master spell books, apart from evil wizards spawned from structures
			* All loot is now less common in dungeon chests, to account for the new structures
			* Tomes of arcana are now much less common
			* Various other loot rarity tweaks
			# Eliminated most cascading worldgen lag (a small amount still remains; this is due to the size of the bigger stuctures)
			# All structures now respect the generated structures world option
			# The rewrite should fix issue #100
			* Removed novice elemental wands from loot tables in favour of elemental crystals
			* Removed the generateLoot config option in favour of finer control over loot injection locations, see above
			Spells:
			+ Added 32 new spells!
			+ Spells can now be cast by placing a spell scroll in a dispenser and powering the dispenser - some spells behave slightly differently to when they are cast by players, and a few spells such as transportation cannot be cast by dispensers
			+ Continuous spells can now be cast using scrolls, and will last for a set duration of 6 seconds in survival mode. They also work in dispensers!
			+ Continuous spells may now have cooldowns, though by default none of them do
			+ Arcane jammer now prevents evokers from casting spells
			+ Added a config option to prevent player block damage, this should stop griefing on servers - the one exception to this is the new Mine spell since that's all it does, but it should still respect block protection mods (if not, you'll have to disable the spell, sorry)
			+ Added a pocket furnace item blacklist to the config
			+ Added sword and bow item whitelists to the config
			* Wizards (and other non-player spell casters) now obey range restrictions for all spells, so no more being electrocuted from 20 blocks away!
			* Wizards now have the decency to tell you which spell you are buying before you buy it - however, it will only count as discovered after you buy it
			* All construct spells including sigils now have anti-overlap, meaning that multiple constructs of the same type cannot be placed such that they intersect - this removes an exploit where constructs (especially sigils) could be stacked up at a single location to deal massive amounts of damage
			* All summoned creatures now increase their attack damage based on the potency the spell was cast with
			* Summoned creatures can now always attack non-players that are attacking their caster (noticeable with, for example, angry wolves)
			* Some spells such as blizzard no longer require the caster to be aiming at the ground in order to cast them, they can now be cast in mid-air just like black hole, fixing issue #132
			* Summoning a spirit horse or wolf when the player already has one now causes the old one to disappear, instead of not allowing the new one to be summoned - this fixes issue #74
			* Wizards can now cast even more of the spells
			* Some projectile spells have had their base ranges reduced to make range upgrades more useful
			* Forcefield's repulsion code has been completely rewritten; it is now impossible for anything to get through that isn't supposed to - this fixes issue #117
			* Forcefield now supports blast modifiers, which increase the forcefield size
			* Forcefield now protects against explosions - you can now stand inside your forcefield and watch creepers blow up in your face without taking a single bit of damage!
			* Blocks can now be placed and broken and entities can now be interacted with inside forcefields; however, you cannot interact with anything outside a forcefield from inside it, and vice versa
			* Sigil spells are now affected by potency modifiers
			* Blast upgrades now affect various spells that weren't affected by them before
			* Firestorm has been renamed to fire breath (any references to the old firestorm spell in existing worlds will change to fire breath)
			* Fireball and greater fireball have had their fireballs replaced with custom ones because the vanilla ones are useless - you can optionally replace all fireballs in the game with these if you prefer them
			* Phase step now allows teleportation through floors and ceilings, and also works as a short-distance teleport that does not require the caster to be looking at a block, unlike blink
			* Summoned silverfish now have a limit to the number of 'generations' that can happen, preventing them from multiplying indefinitely - this fixes issue #143
			* Flame ray and fire breath now support duration modifiers, in the same way as ignite
			* Life drain's healing power has been nerfed slightly, but now scales with potency modifiers
			* Wall of frost now freezes mobs solid if they are caught in its blast
			* Wall of frost now uses frosted ice instead of ice statue blocks, eliminating the large number of tile entities, resulting in improved performance
			* Wall of frost now supports duration modifiers, which will increase the time before the ice breaks
			* Lightning hammer now deals damage to entities on a direct hit
			* Phoenixes now spawn in mid-air instead of on the ground
			* Banish's teleportation radius is now affected by blast modifiers instead of range modifiers. The range of the actual spell shot is still affected by range modifiers.
			* Light is now affected by range modifiers
			* Greater fireball and growth aura are now affected by blast modifiers
			* Glide and flight are now affected by potency modifiers, which in both cases increase flight speed
			* Intimidate is now affected by potency modifiers, which increase the distance mobs will run away
			* Whirlwind is now affected by potency modifiers, which increase the repulsion speed
			* Ice spikes can now be summoned on walls and ceilings
			* Ice charge now spawns ice shards with greater velocity
			* Diamondflesh now gives resistance IV instead of resistance V
			* The code now allows wizards to cast most master spells, but only wizards spawned from shrines will actually do so naturally - but you can make any wizard cast master spells by right-clicking them with a master spell book in creative mode (at your own risk!)
			* All spells now respect the mobGriefing gamerule
			# All spells no longer hit entities that are in the process of dying
			# Transience now prevents all damage except being out of the world, as was originally intended - you can now jump off a cliff and land unharmed under its effects
			# Spirit wolves now spawn with a full 40 health instead of 8 (the value for untamed wolves, which was incorrectly used in previous versions)
			# Decoy now has a greater chance to trick mobs the higher the potency, as it should (it was less before... my bad!)
			# Pocket furnace no longer smelts weapons, tools or armour, fixing issue #115
			# Fixed issue #30, where Potion Core (or any other mod that modifies vanilla invulnerability timers) would cause continuous spells to deal damage in very quick succession in certain cases - the config-based workaround should no longer be necessary
			# Fixed issue #69, where discover spells would (sometimes?) reset client-side on player death
			# Fixed issue #137, where summoned iron golems would behave like village ones instead of player-built ones
			# Fixed issue #150, where lightning hammer caused a crash with LordCraft installed
			The Wizard's Handbook:
			+ Added a movable bookmark to The Wizard's Handbook
			+ Added more images to The Wizard's Handbook
			+ The Wizard's Handbook now adds pages as and when you discover the relevant item, location or thing, so that new players don't have a huge wall of text to start off with (and to encourage you people to actually read the thing!)
			+ Added a (client-side) config option to switch this behaviour off for the wizardry veterans out there
			+ Added a config option controlling whether wizardry's books pause the game when opened in singleplayer, fixing issue #126
			* The Wizard's Handbook is now defined in a JSON file, allowing for much more flexibility in its structure and formatting - it now supports:
			> Inline and animated crafting recipes, which are loaded dynamically from defined recipe JSON files
			> Inline images with captions > Customisable text colours
			> Inline hyperlinks to sections of the book and external websites
			> Customisable contents lists, complete with automatically-generated hyperlinks
			> Advancement triggers for book sections
			* Updated and reorganised the information in The Wizard's Handbook
			# As a result of the changes, text now wraps properly regardless of the font, language or book contents, fixing issue #58
			# Fixed issue #145, where the handbook background was coloured if the GL colour was not set to white by whatever was drawn before it
			Mod Integration / Compatibility:
			+ Added Baubles integration for the new artefacts - if Baubles is installed, they are active when worn in the appropriate Baubles slot, otherwise they are active when on the hotbar (and are limited to the same number as the Baubles slots would allow)
			+ Added Antique Atlas integration for wizard towers and the two new structures, shrines and obelisks - each has its own dedicated marker type, and by default global markers will be added as the structures are generated
			+ Added mod integration options to the config file
			# Added the damage safety checker, fixing issues #72 and #89 - this system allows wizardry to detect an imminent crash before it happens and divert the damage to prevent it
			# Fixed issue #125, a crash with the Applied Energistics 2 terminal
			# Fixed issues #66 and #153, an exploit where wands and armour could be refilled with mana using item repair methods from other mods
			Technical/Commands:
			+ Added support for positional spell casting using commands, meaning players and command blocks can cast spells at any location as if there was a dispenser there
			+ Spells now each have their own JSON file located under assets/ebwizardry/spells, which defines the spell's base attributes and where it can appear and be used - this means they can now be tweaked using resource packs
			> On a server, you'll need to modify the jar in the same way you would for recipes or advancements - but the changes will be sent to clients automatically
			+ Added proper advancement triggers, meaning you can make custom advancements for certain actions in wizardry including spell casting, spell discovery and arcane workbench use
			* Continuous spells cast via commands now last for a certain duration which may be specified in the command, or left as the default 5 seconds, similar to the /effect command
			* Assigning spells to wizards via right-clicking in creative now displays a chat readout
			* Increased the config limit for player/NPC damage scaling from 20 to 255
			* Wizardry's commands now respect the sendCommandFeedback gamerule (with the exception of /allies, since that's all it does)
			# Eliminated several ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsExceptions caused by wand NBT in commands
			Miscellaneous:
			+ Ice wraiths now occasionally spawn at night in tundra, ice spikes and ice mountains biomes
			+ Lightning wraiths now occasionally spawn in any biome during thunderstorms
			+ Added config options to control mob spawning
			+ Added a config option for changing the items required to buy items from wizards, useful if, for example, your modpack has a currency item such as coins
			+ Added Korean translations, thanks to rewi_wire and shejery
			+ Added French translations, thanks to Hahdrim
			+ Added Brazilian Portugese translations, thanks to lorrampi
			* The ally designation system now takes tamed creatures into account, including those from other mods (assuming they use the vanilla system): creatures tamed by you or an ally will not be targeted by your spells, even when you are not logged in
			* Due to internal changes (namely that they now implement IEntityOwnable), other mods should now recognise that your summoned creatures and constructs belong to you - actual effects will vary between mods
			* The friendly fire config option now has four settings: All (allow all friendly fire), Only players (prevent friendly fire on creatures summoned/tamed by you or an ally, but allow it on allied players), Only minions/pets (prevent friendly fire on players, but allow it on creatures summoned/tamed by you or an ally), and None (prevent all friendly fire)
			* The minion revenge targeting config option now works on everything the ADS works on, so your pets, your friends and their pets will now be completely safe if it is disabled
			* Wizard trades are a bit less expensive now, and diamonds have been removed from the potential items bought
			* Reorganised wizardry's advancements, added some new ones and removed some old ones
			* Updated Russian translations, thanks to kellixon
			* Reorganised and improved the config file and GUI
			* Polar bears are now immune to frost damage
			# Binding the next/previous spell keys to mouse buttons finally works properly - gaming mouse users, rejoice!
			# Fixed issue #116, where the server would freeze when it received an invalid arcane workbench packet (this now prints a warning instead)
			# Squashed a load of other little bugs
			Internal/Development:
			+ Improved API support for adding new elements
			+ Improved API support for adding new tiers, you'll probably need to do some of the legwork yourself though
			+ Added the ISpellCastingItem interface, allowing custom spellcasting items to be defined without needing to extend ItemWand
			+ Added the IManaStoringItem interface, allowing custom implementations of mana storage (such as NBT)
			+ Added a spell data system to WizardData which allows data of any type to be stored in it. This is done by specifying a key which is an IVariable<T>, where T is the type of data you want to store. The system also allows automatic saving to NBT through supplied converter functions, see IStoredVariable. There are a number of static methods for generating keys for primitives and other common data types in StoredVariable. The system is completely optional, so you may well not even need to use it.
			* Reorganised some of the packages
			* Moved a lot of methods around in an effort to improve code navigability and separation of concerns. There shouldn't be too many external changes, but some helper methods may be somewhere different to before (notably: raytracing, NBT helpers and the ally designation system).
			* Significantly refactored the structure and hierarchy of the spell classes, introducing a set of standardised superclasses for similar types of spells. These changes should be backwards-compatible except for a few minor tweaks/name changes, though these are insignificant compared to the changes required as part of the spell JSON system - HOWEVER, it is highly recommended that spell classes are converted over to extend the appropriate superclass wherever possible. This will likely result in deletion of a lot of copied code.
			* Introduced spell properties, which are the code representation of the base_properties object in the new spell JSON files. You'll need to make JSON files for all your spells and plug in their tier, element, cost, etc. (I have a code snippet that generates the standard stuff for you, give me a shout). The more involved part is taking the hardcoded constants ('properties') out of your spells and moving them over to the JSON file so that users can change them. Your spells will still work without doing this, so which things you choose to give users control over is up to you. See my spell classes for examples.
			* Decoupled spell metadata from the numbers used in packets. This fixes a problem where removing a spell from a world (perhaps by uninstalling a spell pack) would result in the game crashing when trying to sync spell glyph data. Spells now have a network ID which must be used for packets, see Spell#networkID() and Spell#byNetworkID(int). For clarity, the Spell#id() and Spell#get(int) methods have been renamed to metadata() and byMetadata() respectively. N.B. Spell metadata is likely to be phased out in future updates in preparation for 1.13 and the flattening, network IDs are the first step towards that.
			* Rewrote the particle system, pretty much from the ground up. Wizardry particles must now be spawned using the particle builder - see electroblob.wizardry.util.ParticleBuilder for more details. It's pretty self-explanatory though, this isn't a difficult change to make. You can even add your own particles to this system!
			* Improvements and changes to spell casting events and modifiers to accommodate dispenser casting, including proper support for cooldown modifiers and integration of cost into the modifiers system - fixing issue #140
			* Allies are now stored as UUIDs, as are owners of summoned creatures and constructs, which now also implement IEntityOwnable. The ally system has been tweaked accordingly and there are a few extra helper methods for it, see electroblob.wizardry.util.AllyDesignationSystem for details. This change fixes issue #113 and possibly #21.

		ExtraCells-1.12.2-2.6.5:
			More fixes to OreDictExporter. Should've been released last month, but got busy IRL and forgot about it.
			Updated Russian language file thanks to [bigenergy (#671).](https://github.com/ExtraCells/ExtraCells2/commits?author=bigenergy)
			Please remove XCPatch if it is installed. It is no longer required, and will cause a crash if it is installed.

		ExtraCells-1.12.2-2.6.4:
			* Fixed crash on load when running without AE2 Wireless Crafting Terminals (#669)
			* Fixed crash on load relating to FluidHandler implemented on placeholder fluid item (#668)

		ExtraCells-1.12.2-2.6.3:
			* Fixed AE2WTLib incompatibilities caused by compiling against old version.
			* Rewritten OreDict export bus filter handling.
			Has NOT been robustly tested in detail. Making a release here as I am unable to upload new releases on curseforge and that EC2 is really overdue for an update anyway.

		FoamFix 0.10.10 (1.12.2):

			* Added the "client.deduplicateModels" option, to disable specifically deduplication of baked models.

		FoamFix 0.10.8 (1.12.2):
			Automatically disables patches (suspected to be) unsafe (and/or expected to be handled by due to other patches) in combination with JustEnoughIDs and SpongeForge.

		FoamFix 0.10.7 (1.12.2):
			Barring more crash bugs, this is probably the final FoamFix release for 1.12.2.
			It mostly removes functionality which I couldn't manage to fix in time (or people kept force-enabling against defaults despite the resulting instability), but it also tries to fix some other patches.

		Twilight Forest - MC 1.12.2 - 3.9.974:
			* Dev build for early testing, expect crashes.
			* Remember to back up your worlds first!

	Tinkers Construct (TConstruct-1.12.2-2.12.0.157.jar --> TConstruct-1.12.2-2.13.0.183.jar):
		TConstruct-1.12.2-2.13.0.183.jar:
			Special bugfix release:
			This version fixes a crash that sometimes happens when also using VanillaFix, which currently is in a lot of modpacks. Since there seems to be no active maintainer for the mod, we decided to deactivate what it does for TiC rendering ourselves. This only impacts the fluids rendered by TiC itself in some blocks.

		TConstruct-1.12.2-2.13.0.179.jar:

			Features

			* Happens when crafting slime boots, slimeslings, congealed slime, and slime channels
			* Config option available to make crafting the vanilla slime block also return pink when made with mismatching or non-Tinkers slime types
			* Slime Blocks
			* Instead of crafting Tinkers slime blocks out of congealed slime and 5 slimeballs, they now use the vanilla recipe of 9 slimeballs
			* Removed green as it was redundant to the vanilla block
			* Quark Colored Slme
			* If Quark is installed, Tinkers slime blocks will work with the Quark colored slime feature
			* Green, blue, purple, magma, and blood slime blocks will not stick to each other
			* Pink slime blocks (see above) will stick to all colors
			* Green, blue, and blood slime blocks can be used in place of Quark's green, blue and blood slimeblocks to craft the other colors and to stick to secondary colors
			* Slime naming
			* Now are more consisent with vanilla
			* Slimeballs are no longer called "Slime ball"
			* Most slime items no longer have colors for consistency

			* Longswords now have a slight delay after use, giving a window to activate a shield
			* Longswords now have an animation while charging
			* Rapiers now allow a shield to be used while jumping back
			* Projectiles like shurikens now light the target on fire if the projectile is on fire
			* Hellish now boosts damage to mobs that are not immune to fire rather than the weird biome spawn list that missed many nether mobs.
			* Smelteries
			* Full smelteries no longer attempt to alloy or finish melting items
			* When out of fuel, the smeltery tooltip now displays "No valid fuel" instead of sometimes displaying "Not enough space"
			* Renamed "Smeltery Drain" to "Seared Drain" and "Faucet" to "Seared Faucet" for consistency
			* Misc
			* Slime trees once again have drippers
			* Added a new config option to disallow non-leashable mobs from being picked up by piggybackpacks
			Fixes
			* General
			* Fixed wooden hoppers deleting contents when rotated
			* Fixed slime recipe fallbacks giving hte wrong color
			* Fixed blood being too hot
			* Fix replacing the piggybackpack with another chestplate not dropping the entity
			* Smelteries
			* Fixed full smelteries sometimes filling with negative liquids

			* Fixed stone tool parts melting too fast
			* Fixed smeltery dropping items clientside when breaking under some conditions
			* Fix crash when casting channels are filled from an invalid side
			* Fixed being able to drain fluids from an invactive smeltery or tinker tank
			* Tools
			* Fixed Tinkers weapons not applying knockback to players
			* Fixed no sound effects when attacking with Tinkers weapons
			* Fixed no sounds when breaking tools
			* Fixed pigiron having wrong nom chance when between 2.5 and 5 chickenwings

	Torchmaster (torchmaster_1.12.2-1.7.1.74.jar --> torchmaster_1.12.2-1.8.1.81.jar):
		torchmaster_1.12.2-1.8.1.81.jar:
			v1.8.1
			* Slightly improved the Feral Flare Lantern Bounding Box
			* Improved compatibility with Lycanites Mobs
			v1.8.0
			* FIX: Fixed rendering of the dread lamp glass texture
			* FIX: Improved compatibility with quark mobs (stonelings and frogs in particular, both should be blocked by the dread lamp)
			* NEW: Added /torchmaster_entity_dump command. Dumps all registered entities to the log file (Registered to the game, the mega torch and dread lamp)
			* NEW: Added /torchmaster_list_torches command. Dumps all mega torches and dread lamps of loaded dimensions to the log file
			*  NEW: Added mega torch and dread lamp white/black listing option
			* Format: [PREFIX][MODNAMESPACE]:[ENTITYNAME]
			*  Valid Prefixes:
			* +: Adds an entity to the list, effectively blocking it from being able to spawn
			* -: Removes an entity from the list, effectively allowing it to spawn
			*  Examples:
			* Block Bats from spawning: +minecraft:bat
			* Allow pigs to spawn: -minecraft:pig
			* Block Quark Stonelings from spawning: +quark:stoneling
			* Use the /torchmaster_entity_dump command to obtain a full list of available entities (in the game log file)
			v1.7.1
			* FIX: Fixed an issue with the Feral Flare Lantern that could lead to chunk corruption when placed close to the world height limit.
			*  NEW: Added a configuration option to limit the amount of lights a Feral Flare Lantern can place.
			* Warning: Setting this value in conjunction with the radius and light level setting too high can still lead to chunk corruption! Dont be stupid. You dont need a light at every possible block in a chunk.
			v1.7.0
			* CHANGE: The Mega Torch and Dread Lamp now work in a cube instead of a cylinder. This should make it much easier to setup torches without overlap or deadspots. The Size of the cube is Range + 1 in each direction. A range of 64 (default) will result in a cube of 129 by 129 blocks with the torch as its center.
			* NEW [Beta]: Mega Torches can now visualize the range at which they work. Use any dye to render a visual representation of the torches working volume. Use any dye or an empty hand to disable the renderer. The renderer will also disable itself when you change dimensions or get out of viewing range.
			* NEW: Feral Flare Lanterns can now be configured to only place lights in line of sight. Simply rightclick the lantern to open the gui. At the moment this mechanic feels a bit clunky, so there will be changes in a future release.
			* NEW: Mega Torches should now be able to suppress those scary cave ambient sounds
			v1.6.4
			* FIX: reworked torch storage system to use capabilities instead of a global file. This fixes an issue with torches not working in most modded dimensions after a restart. You might need to replace your torches and lamps for the changes to take effect.
			v1.6.3
			* FIX: Moved russian language files to correct location
			v1.6.2
			* Updated to latest stable MCForge Version (14.23.3.2655)
			* FIX: Feral Flare Lantern now uses the configuration option for its tick rate
			* FIX: Torches should no longer work across multiple world saves
			* FIX: Added small workaround to prevent a crash during world startup on certain modpacks
			* FIX: Improved Terrain lighter compatibility with replaceable blocks
			* CHANGE: Removed some Logging Spam (and added more :D well, just for some errors)
			v1.6.1
			* Fix Mega Torch and Dread Lamp not working (oops...)
			v1.6.0
			* Add Feral Flare Lantern (Illuminates a big area with a configurable minimum light level, default 16 radius)
			* Add Frozen Pearl (Removes nearby invisible feral flare light sources)
			v1.5.3
			* Changed buildscript and configuration to be compatible with 1.12 and 1.12.1+
			v1.5.2
			* Update to forge 14.22.0.2445
			* Marked as stable release
			* WARNING: IF YOU UPDATE FROM 1.4.3 OR EARLIER YOU WILL NEED TO REPLACE YOUR TORCHES AND LAMPS!
			v1.5.1
			* Switched torchmaster logging to debug instead of info to reduce log spam
			v1.5.0
			* Added beginner tooltips to the mega torch, dread lamp and terrain lighter
			* Added persistent torch registry (Allows torches and lamps to work while not being chunk loaded)
			* MC 1.12 versions of this mod are now signed, yey!
			v1.4.3
			* Updated to forge 14.21.0.2363, fixes a crash on startup due to the forge registry changes.
